            <h2>JS Ninja Chapter 8: Forms</h2>
            <!-- Write notes here -->
            <h5>A search bar</h5>
            <form name="search" action="/search">
                <input type="text" name="searchInput" placeholder="Search Here">
                <button type="submit">Search</button>
            </form>
            <h3>Form elements:</h3>
            <p class="question">Why put things in a form rather than just grouping the elements together?</p>
            <p class="question">How does this form know to press that button when the enter key is pressed?</p>
            <p>Action attribute: the url that the form will be submitted to</p>
            <p>Name attribute: used to access the information inside of it</p>

            <h3>Form Properties and Methods</h3>
            <p>form.submit() will submit the form automatically (but doesn't trigger submit event)</p>
            <p>form.reset() will reset the form</p>
            <p>form.action property can set the action attribute of a form</p>

            <h3>Form events</h3>
            <p>Focus: (when cursor is placed or when it is tabbed to)</p>
            <p>Blur: when focus is moved away</p>
            <p>Change: when something is actually changed</p>
            <p>Submits the form to url, unless you intercept it with js to do something else.</p>

            <h3>Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form</h3>
            <p>value property retrieves text in a field</p>

            <h3>Form Controls</h3>
            <p>input</p><input type="text">
            <p>select: drop down</p><select name="Select" id=""></select>
            <p>textarea</p><textarea name="" id="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
            <p>button</p><button>Click me!</button>
            <br><br>

            <form id="hero">
                <label for='heroName'>Name:
                    <input type='text' id='heroName' name='heroName' autofocus placeholder='Your Super Hero Name'
                        maxlength=32>
                </label>
                <label for='realName'>Real Name:
                    <input type='password' name='realName' id='realName'></label>
                <p>Super Powers:</p>
                <label for='flight'>Flight:
                    <input type='checkbox' id='flight' value='Flight' name='powers'>
                </label>
                <label for='strength'>Super Strength:
                    <input type='checkbox' id='strength' value='Strength' name='powers'>
                </label>
                <label for='speed'>Super Speed:
                    <input type='checkbox' id='speed' value='Super Speed' name='powers'>
                </label>
                <label for='energy'>Energy Blasts:
                    <input type='checkbox' id='energy' value='Energy Blasts' name='powers'>
                </label>
                <label for='telekinesis'>Telekinesis:
                    <input type='checkbox' id='telekinesis' value='Telekinesis' name='powers'>
                </label>
                <p>What type of hero are you?</p>
                <label for='hero'>Hero:
                    <input type='radio' name='category' value='Hero' id='hero'>
                </label>
                <label for='villain'>Villain:
                    <input type='radio' name='category' value='Villain' id='villain'>
                </label>
                <label for='anti-hero'>Anti-Hero:
                    <input type='radio' name='category' value='Antihero' id='anti-hero'>
                </label>
                <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
            </form>

            <h3>Inputs</h3>
            <p>text</p>
            <p>password</p>
            <p>checkbox</p>
            <p>Radio Buttons</p>
            <p>Hidden inputs: for stuff the user doesn't need to fill out again.</p>
            <p>File input: lets user add a file</p>
            <p>number</p>
            <p>select: drop downs</p>

            <h3>Form validation</h3>
            <p>Front end validation is for making a better user experience. Server side validation is for actually
                making sure everything is correct.</p>
            <p>You can add validation in the html, but this is not the best way since it is not consistent across
                browsers.</p>
            <p>Add event listeners to check the form as the user types, not just when it is submitted</p>
            <p>Disable the submit button if there are errors in the form.</p>

            <h2>JS Ninja Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h2>
            <!-- Write notes here -->
            <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
            <p>Inner workings are kept hidden in the object, and only essential functions are exposed to user.</p>

            <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
            <p>The same processes can be used for different objects. Various objects have the same method, but also have
                the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>

            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <p>Taking features of one object and adding new features.</p>

            <h3>Classes</h3>
            <p>Classes define blueprint.</p>

            <h3>Constructor Functions</h3>
            <p>A function to create objects.</p>
            <p>Javascript has some built in constructor functions for Object, Array, and Function. But you can also
                write your own constructor functions</p>

            <h3>ES6 Class Declarations</h3>
            <p>Now you can uses classes with Javascript</p>

            <h3>The Constructor Property</h3>
            <p>All objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that created it</p>
            <p>Use constructor property to instantiate a copy of an object without having to refernce it directly.</p>

            <h3>Static Methods</h3>
            <p>Static methods are for by the class directly, rather than the instance of the class.</p>

            <h3>Protypal Inheritance</h3>
            <p>Prototype properties are shared by every instance of the class</p>

            <h3>The Prototype Property</h3>
            <p>Prototype property returns an object</p>
            <p>Lets you add properties and methods to a class</p>
            <p>ex: turtle.prototype</p>
            <p>Prototype always refers to the instance that calls a method</p>
            <p>getPrototypeOf()</p>
            <p class="question">What is a prototype?</p>
            <p>Prototype should be used to add new properties and methods after the class has been declared. Use it to
                add things that will be the same for every instance of the class.</p>
            <p>Never use arrays or objects as default value in a prototype.</p>

            <h3>Public and Private Methods</h3>
            <p>Methods and properties are public be default. They can ve queried directly and changed by assignment.</p>
            <p>By creatign a variable inside the constructor function, it can't be accessed outside of that scope.</p>
            <p>Use getter and setter methods to form closure over a variable and provide controlled access</p>
            <p>Add these functions as methods to the class.</p>
            <p>In these getter/setter functions, you can add filtering, for example, to make sure color is only set to a
                string</p>

            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <p>Every prototype has its own prototype, which inherits the properties of the previous one, creating a
                chain of inheritance.</p>
            <img src="./jsninja2.jpg" alt="diagram">

            <h3>The Object Constructor</h3>
            <p>All objects ultimately inherit from the the prototype of the object constructor function</p>
            <p>All objects have built in methods that are inherited from the object prototype</p>

            <h3>Enumerable Properties</h3>
            <p>If a property is not enumerable, it won't show up when you try to loop through an object's properties.
            </p>
            <p>Built in methods are usually not enumerable, user defined methods are usually enumerable.</p>

            <h3>Inheritance Using extends</h3>
            <p>Use extends to avoid polluting the more generic version of a class with a more specific version.</p>

            <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
            <p>A secret: Primitive values are actually objects in the background. That's how they have methods.</p>
            <p>You can even override built in methods for the classes you create. For example, toString() is not that
                useful when applied to objects. You can write your own toString() method to do what you want it to do.
            </p>

            <h3>Adding Methods to Built In Objects</h3>
            <p>Cool, but frowned upon.</p>
            <p>Monkey patching is when you modify built in object methods.</p>
            <p>Instead, you can use extneds to create your own class based off one of the built in classes.</p>

            <h3>Property Attributes and Descriptors</h3>
            <p>An object that contains the values of properties</p>
            <ul>
                <li>value: the value of the property</li>
                <li>writable: whether it can be changed or not</li>
                <li>enumerable: whether it will show up in a loop</li>
                <li>configurable: whether you can delete the property or change its attributes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can change the property attributes for your own stuff</p>

            <h4>Getting and Setting Property Descriptors</h4>
            <p>Use Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() to see the property descriptors</p>
            <p>Use Object.defineProperty to set them</p>

            <h4>Getters and Setters</h4>
            <p>Uses to have fine grained control over how properties are assigned</p>
            <p>For example, prohibit the number of sides on a dice from being set to a negative number</p>

            <h3>Creating Objects from Other Objects</h3>
            <p>create() method can be used to make a copy of an object</p>
            <p>Then you can modify it to make it more specific</p>

            <h3>Object Prototype Chain</h3>
            <p>Creating objects from objects makes a prototype chain</p>
            <img src="./jsninja3.jpg" alt="diagram">

            <h3>Mixins</h3>
            <p>Used to add properties from one object to another without using inheritance</p>
            <p>This creates a shallow copy (copied by reference, both point to the same spot in memory)</p>
            <p>Mixin(objectName, properties)</p>

            <h3>Factory Functions</h3>
            <p>Used to return an object</p>


            <h3>Chaining Functions</h3>
            <p>If a method returns 'this', it's methods can be chained together to form a sequence of methods that are
                called ina row. method1().method2().method3()</p>

            <h3>Binding this</h3>
            <p>Use that = this to prevent this from getting stuck to the global object</p>
            <p>Or use bind(this)</p>
            <p>bind sets the value of this in a function. It will be bound to the object calling the original method.
            </p>
            <p>In arrow functions, this is bound to the original object making the function call</p>

            <h3>Borrowing Methods from Prototypes</h3>
            <p>Example: slice = Array.prototype.slice to make slice available to array like things that are not arrays.
            </p>
            <p>Then use slice.call()</p>
            <p>But in es6 you can use array.from() to turn an array-like object into an array</p>

            <h3>Composition Over Inheritance</h3>
            <p>Create small objects that describe single tasks and use them to build more complex ones.</p>
            <p>Air on the side of classes having less stuff in them.</p>
            <p>Keep inheritance chains short</p>
            <p>Borrow a method using something like Gorilla.prototyp.banana, rather than inheriting the method.</p>
            <p>Or even move banana to a separate object and make it a mixin wherever it is needed.</p>

            <h2>JS Ninja Chapter 15: Modern Javascript</h2>
            <!-- Write notes here -->
            <h3>Libraries</h3>
            <p>A piece of code that provides methods that make it easier to achieve tasks.</p>
            <p>For example, jQuery makes shorter DOM manipulation</p>

            <h4>jQuery</h4>
            <p>Widely used and good support for older browsers.</p>
            <p>Uses $ as alias for jquery object</p>

            <h4>Underscore and Lodash</h4>
            <p>Provide utility functions under namespace _</p>

            <h4>Advantages and disadvantages of libraries</h4>
            <p>advantage: lots of testing</p>
            <p>disadvantages: extra code.</p>

            <h3>Modular JavaScript</h3>
            <p>Keep modules that are small, with single purpose to avoid wasting code.</p>
            <p>Coupling: how dependent elements of code are to each other. </p>
            <p>Keep code loosely coupled.</p>

            <h4>ES6 Modules</h4>
            <p>Each module has its own scope.</p>
            <p>You can just import one thing at a time.</p>
            <p>Things that are exported are public.</p>
            <p>Default exports can be imported without having to be named.</p>

            <h4>Node.js Modules</h4>
            <p>Uses different syntax</p>
            <p>Use keyword require to import a module.</p>

            <h3>MVC Frameworks</h3>
            <p>Model-View-controller</p>
            <p>3 components:</p>
            <p>Models: objects that implement functionality for CRUD tasks.</p>
            <p>Views: Visual representation (HTML on a webpage)</p>
            <p>Controllers: link models and views together. Respond to events.</p>
            <p>Templating languages are cool because they loosen coupling between html and js.</p>
            <p>Insert javascript into html</p>
            <p>Angular</p>
            
            <h4>Web Components</h4>
            <p>React and Vue</p>
            <p>For designing interactive web applications, as opposed to web pages where it is better to keep separation of languages</p>

            <h3>Package Managers</h3>
            <p>Package: a directory with code files and package.json</p>
            <p>Dependency management: ensuring all dependency requirements are met.</p>
            <p>npm is great</p>
            <p>npm init: when you start a project, creates packagejson</p>
            <p>packagese are kept in node_modules folder</p>
            <p>npm install will install packages</p>
            <p>devDependency: things that you use for development, but not required for the program to run.</p>
            <p>To add dev dependency, use --save-dev flag</p>
            <p>Don't normally install something globablly unless you use it all the time.</p>
            <p>yarn is cool too.</p>

            <h4>Content Delivery Network</h4>
            <p>Use a build tool like webpack to take straing off browser.</p>
            
            <h3>Deploying JavaScript</h3>
            <p>Rather than having to worry about attaching all the scripts in the right order, put them all in a single minified file.</p>
            <p>Called bundle.min.js</p>

            <h4>Transpiling Code</h4>
            <p>Transpilers turn new javascript code into old code that old browsers understand.</p>
            <p>Babel is cool.</p>

            <h4>Minification</h4>
            <p>removes comments and whitespace and other stuff you don't need.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>YUI Compressor</li>
                <li>Google's Closure</li>
                <li>Uglify.JS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also do server side compression</p>

            <h4>Folder Structure</h4>
            <p>Make folders to keep things in</p>
            <p>Put stuff that needs to be transpiled in the src folder</p>
            <p>Put the output of transpiled code in the dist (distribution) folder</p>
            <p>Put modules in the lib folder</p>
            <p>Organize modules even further if you have a bunch of them</p>
            <h5>An example of organization by type:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    src 
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>JS</li>
                        <li>views</li>
                        <li>tests</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>dist
                    <ul>
                        <li>index.html</li>
                        <li>bundle.min.js</li>
                        <li>package.json</li>
                        <li>node_modules</li>
                        <li>README</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Modular Organization</h4>
            <p>Grouping files be feature rather than by type.</p>
            <p>Good for working with teams because it keeps different stuff from interfering with other stuff.</p>

            <h4>Webpack</h4>
            <p>Handy module bundler</p>
            <ul>
                <li>transpiles</li>
                <li>minifies</li>
                <li>lints</li>
                <li>tests</li>
                <li>compiles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can automate it to do whatever you need.</p>

            <h2>Class Notes</h2>
