    <h2>EJS Chapter 2: Program Structure</h2>
    <h3>Expressions and Statements</h3>
    <p>See JS file as well</p>
    <p>Expression: produces a value</p>
    <p>Statement: full statement, includes semicolon</p>
    <h3>Bindings</h3>
    <img src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-3b5vpig99v/products/498499/images/434811/Tentacle__09166.1590611949.386.513.jpg?c=2 alt="
        Tentacles">
    <p>Binding means variable. It is the way the code remembers new stuff</p>
    <p>'let' means: we are going to define a binding</p>
    <p>'=' operator means, lets disconnect this from current binding and assign it to a new one.</p>
    <p>Bindings are tentacles, not boxes. They grasp, not hold values. Multiple bindings can be attached to the same
        value.</p>
    <p>Undefined = the tentacle is holding nothing</p>
    <script>
        //define multiple bindings in one statement:
        let one = 1,
            two = 2;
    </script>
    <p>var and const work too, but in different ways</p>
    <p>
        Some words you can't use for binding names: <Br> break case catch class const continue debugger default
        delete do else enum export extends false finally for
        function if implements import interface in instanceof let
        new package private protected public return static super
        switch this throw true try typeof var void while with yield
    </p>
    <p>Executing a function: Invoking, calling, or applying it.</p>
    <ul>Useful Functions
        <li>Number.isNaN - returns true if arg is NaN</li>
    </ul>
    <p>{} mean "this is a block of code"</p>
    <script>
        //Do loops: like a while loop.
        // let yourName;
        // do {
        //     // yourName = prompt("Who are you?");
        // } while (!yourName);
        // console.log(yourName)
    </script>
    <h3>Loops</h3>
    <ul>Helpful Loop things:
        <li>Break: stop the loop</li>
        <li>Continue: Stop this iteration of the loop and go to the next iteration.</li>
    </ul>
    <script>
        //Switch Statement Review: 
        //     switch (prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
        //         case "rainy":
        //             console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
        //             break;
        //         case "sunny":
        //             console.log("Dress lightly.");
        //         case "cloudy":
        //             console.log("Go outside.");
        //             break;
        //         default:
        //             console.log("Unknown weather type!");
        //             break;
        //     }
        // 
    </script>

    <h2>EJS Chapter 3: Functions</h2>
    <h3>Bindings and Scopes</h3>
    <p>Each binding has scope - which part of the progam in which it is visible.</p>
    <p>If it's not inside a block or function, it has global scope.</p>
    <p>Inside a block, bindings are local. They are recreated every time that block is used.</p>
    <p>'let' and 'const' are always local to the block in which they are declared. Only the code in that block can see
        it. </p>
    <p>'Var' is only local to a function. If it's not in a function, it's global.</p>
    <h3>Nested Scope</h3>
    <p>Scope can be many levels deep if you have blocks within blocks. </p>
    <h3>Functions as Values</h3>
    <p>myFunction: just function name.</p>
    <p>myFunction(): calling the function.</p>
    <script>
        //Multiple ways to write functions:
        //Functions as values:
        let myFunction = function () {

        }
        //Functions Declaration: 
        function myNewFunction() {

        }

        //Arrow Functions
        const myArrowFunction = () => {

        }
    </script>
    <p>The difference between function expression and function declaration is that function declaration can be called
        before it is defined. Function expresion cannot.</p>
    <h3>The Call Stack</h3>
    <p>The computer must remember where a function is called from so it knows where to go when it is done.</p>
    <p>Call Stack: place where computer stores context history. It makes a stack of what functions are being run, then
        takes it off when it is finished.</p>
    <p>Blwing the stack: when the computer crahses because there is no memory left in the call stack.</p>
    <script>
        //An example of how to blow the stack (do not run this)
        // function chicken(){
        //     return egg();
        // }
        // function egg(){
        //     return chicken();
        // }
        // console.log(chicken() + " came first.");
    </script>
    <h3>Optional Arguments</h3>
    <p>If there are too many arguments, JS ignores the extra.</p>
    <p>If there are too few, the missing ones are assigned undefined</p>
    <p>You can even assign a default value with = next to a parameter.</p>
    <h3>Closure</h3>
    <p>What happens to local bindings when the function call that created them is no longer active??</p>
    <script>
        //example:
        function wrapValue(n) {
            let local = n;
            return () => local;
        }

        let wrap1 = wrapValue(1);
        let wrap2 = wrapValue(2);
        console.log(wrap1());
        // → 1
        console.log(wrap2());
        // → 2
    </script>
    <p>You can still access these bindings.</p>
    <p>A function that references bindings from local scopes around it is called a closure.</p>
    <script>
        //This is interesting: A function to create another function for multiplying.
        function multiplier(factor) {
            return number => number * factor;
        }

        let twice = multiplier(2);
        console.log(twice(5));
        // → 10
    </script>
    <p>Think of it this way: Function values not only contain the code in their body, but also any needed stuff from the
        environment in which they were created.</p>
    <h3>Recursion</h3>
    <p>A function can call itself, as long as it doesn't do it too many times that it overflows that stack.</p>
    <script>
        //recursive function example: 
        function power(base, exponent) {
            if (exponent == 0) {
                return 1;
            } else {
                return base * power(base, exponent - 1);
            }
        }

        console.log(power(2, 3));
        // → 8
    </script>
    <p>However, looping is normally faster.</p>
    <p>Use recursive function in cases where you may need to explore several branches of the same problem.</p>
    <p>Consider this puzzle: by starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an
        infinite set of numbers can be produced. How would you write a function that, given a number, tries to find a
        sequence of such additions and multiplications that produces that number?</p>
    <script>
        //A recursive solution
        function findSolution(target) {
            function find(current, history) {
                if (current == target) {
                    return history;
                } else if (current > target) {
                    return null;
                } else {
                    return find(current + 5, `(${history} + 5)`) ||
                        find(current * 3, `(${history} * 3)`);
                }
            }
            return find(1, "1");
        }

        console.log(findSolution(24));
        // → (((1 * 3) + 5) * 3)
    </script>
    <h3>Growing Functions</h3>
    <p>How difficult it is to find a good name for a function is a good indication of how clear a concept it is that
        you're trying to wrap.</p>
    <p>Don't waste time adding functionality that would not ever be useful</p>
    <h3>Functions and Side Effects</h3>
    <p>Some functions are used more for their side effects than for their return values</p>
    <p>However, you'll probably use functions with return values more than those with side effects</p>
    <p>Pure function: something that doesn't produce side effects or rely on side effects of other code. Doesn't read
        global bindings. It is completely self sufficient. These are the most useful kinds of functions and can be
        easily tested.</p>

    <h2>EJS Chapter 4: Objects and Arrays</h2>
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>Null and undefined have no properties</p>
    <p>Two ways to access properties: dot and [].</p>
    <p>With dot notation, the word after the . is the literal name of the property</p>
    <p>With bracket notation, the stuff inside the brackets is evaluated to the name of the property.</p>
    <p>An advantage to using bracket notation is if the property name doesn't follow the rules for binding names, such
        as numbers.</p>
    <p>The advantage to using the dot notation is that it is easier to write in cases where it can be used.</p>
    <p>Properties can be accessed by value.prop</p>

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>Method: holds a function value.</p>
    <p>Object properties with invalid names must be quoted.</p>
    <p>"in" operator will tell if the object has a property with that name.</p>
    <p>Object.keys returns an array of the object property names.</p>
    <p>Object.assign copies all properties from one object into another. </p>
    <p>An array is just an object that uses a series of numbers as keys.</p>

    <h3>Mutability</h3>
    <p>Primitave values are immutable. you can't change it really. Object contents can change, and it will still be the
        same object.</p>
    <p>Objects have different behavior. You can't just copy the value from one object into another. The new variable
        will still point to the same location in memory. Two objects that have the same contents are not considered ==
    </p>
    <p>Javascript has no built in operator to compare only the contents of two variables.</p>

    <h3>More Array Stuff</h3>
    <ul>Useful array methods:
        <li>push: add element to end of array</li>
        <li>pop: remove element from end of array</li>
        <li>unshift: add element to beginning of array</li>
        <li>shift: remove element from beginning of array</li>
        <li>indexOf: returns index at which requested value is located</li>
        <li>lastIndexOf: does the same thing, but starts from the end of the array</li>
        <li>slice: takes start and end indexes and returns the elements between them</li>
        <li>concat: glues arrays together</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Useful String methods:
        <li>slice</li>
        <li>indexOf - in strings it can find the index of a substring with multiple characters</li>
        <li>trim: removes whitespace</li>
        <li>padStart: adds padding characters up to a certain number of characters</li>
        <li>split: split on occurence of a substring</li>
        <li>join: joins strings together with optional separators</li>
        <li>repeat: creates new string with glued together copies of the original string</li>
        <li>length</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rest Parameters</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you want a function to accept any number of arguments</p>
    <p>put three dots before teh function's last parameter</p>
    <p>This creates an array containing all further arguments</p>
    <p>You can put the triple dot operator into another array as well. This inserts another array into it.</p>

    <h3>The Math Object</h3>
    <p>Math object exists to give a global binding to all the useful math things, to avoid polluting the namespace.</p>
    <p>It is traditional to write constant values (like PI) in all caps</p>

    <h3>Destructuring</h3>
    <p>I need to learn more about this.</p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment</a>

    <h3>JSON</h3>
    <ul>JSON rules:
        <li>All property names need double quotes</li>
        <li>Only simple data expressoins are allowed - no computations or comments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember: JSON.stringify and JSON.parse</p>
