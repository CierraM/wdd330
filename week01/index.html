    <h2>Master Mobile UX Course Notes</h2>
    <h3>Rewire your brain</h3>
    <p><em>If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your
        core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it'll be like
        trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bankd, which is neither simple, nor beautiful.</em><br>-Joel Marsh</p>
    <p>Do mobile first because people will be way more likely to be using the mobile device. It's easier to grow things
      than shrink them.</p>
    <p>Responsive != mobile first</p>
    <h3>Understand Users</h3>
    <p><em>It's really hard to design products by focus groups. a lot of times people don't know what they want until
        you show it to them. </em><br>-Steve Jobs</p>
    <p>People don't know what they want. Be there to show them where to go and what to do. Be useful, help them
      accomplish their purpose. Be quick. Nobody has an attention span these days. Make interactions smooth and
      seamless. Delete extra steps they don't need.</p>
    <p>Reachability - people rely on their thumbs to reach things on their phone. Make important things easy to reach.
    </p>
    <p>Speed - even .5 second can make a huge difference. And a lot of people don't have fast internet.</p>
    <p>Assets - Use svg and webfonts when possible. Optimize and minify whenever possible. </p>
    <h3>Strategic Menu Design</h3>
    <p>Be empathetic to users. They are not always good at figuring out unintuitive software. </p>
    <p>Why is menu always all the way at the top where you can't even reach it?? Put it down at the bottom where the
      thumb can get it. </p>
    <p>Problems with the hamburger menu - not everyone knows what that is! The word "menu" with the border makes a lot
      more sense.</p>
    <h3>Mobile Friendly Forms</h3>
    <p>Problems with forms: Too much uncessary information that make the form too long. </p>
    <p>Things to try: ditch the extra labels. Make inputs taller for thumbs. </p>
    <p>Float labels are cool.</p>
    <p>Note to self: learn <a href="https://css-tricks.com/float-labels-css/">how to make a float label</a> </p>
    <p>Make bigger checkboxes</p>
    <p>Ask the user what they want. Then only make them fill out relevant info.</p>
    <p>Comments: make placeholder specific to what you want</p>
    <p>paginate forms. And use a progress indicator.</p>
    <p>Also enable auto complete:<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete">See
        here for more info.</a></p>
    <p>Passwords - masking can make it frustrating. Have option to show or hide password. </p>
    <p>Credit cards - Auto spacing is cool for easy entry. Maybe even put everything in the same input. </p>
    <p>Choose which keyboard to use on mobile. If it's just numbers, the letter keyboard will be cumbersome. <a
        href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/ux-html5-mobile-form-part-2/">Helpful article</a></p>
    <p>Make phonenumbers callable by putting them in an anchor tag. No more copy/paste!</p>
    <h3>Better Mobile Advertising</h3>
    <p>Research to understand the way people use mobile devices.</p>
    <p>Too many ads are very very annoying on mobile.</p>
    <p>How to make mobile ads better:</p>
    <p>Make them very small and simple. Not taking up the whole screen. </p>
    <p>Cool idea: put a window to show a full screen add between the content. </p>
    <p>Just don't use pop ups. They came for content, not ads. </p>
