        <h1>Week 09 Notes</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>The Window Object</h2>
            <p>Every browser window, tab, popu, frame, and iframe has a window object.</p>
            <p>In a browser environment, the browser object and the global object are the same thing.</p>
            <p>Find the global object by using 'this' in a global scope.</p>

            <h4>Going Global</h4>
            <p>Global variables are properties of a global object.</p>
            <p>Functions like parseInt() are methods of global object.</p>
            <p>Except some of these are part of the number object now in es6.</p>
            <p>window.alert, confirm, and prompt</p>
            <p>Don't use these too much. Maybe to confirm if a user wants to delete a resource.</p>

            <h4>Which Browser?</h4>
            <p>accessing the navigator window property will return Navigator object, containing info about the browser.
            </p>
            <p>This is not reliable though.</p>

            <h4>Location</h4>
            <p>window.location returns an object with infor about the current page url.</p>
            <p>href property retursn url. It can be rewritten to direct the page to a new url.</p>
            <p>reload() method can force a page reload. Given parameter of true, it will reload from the server instead
                of using cached page.</p>
            <p>assign() will load another resource from url. replace() will do the same thing, but won't store it in
                history.</p>

            <h3>Browser History</h3>
            <p>window.history lets you access history from previously visited pages in the current browser session.
                different from html5 history api.</p>
            <p>window.history.go() is used to go to a specific page, 0 is the current page</p>

            <h3>Controlling Windows</h3>
            <p>Use window.open(url, title, attributes) lets you open a new window.</p>
            <button onclick="openWindow()">Open a new window</button>
            <p>window.moveTo(), move the window to the top-left corner of screen.</p>
            <p>Popups are very annoying</p>

            <h3>Screen Information</h3>
            <p>find info about the screen width and height</p>

            <h3>The Document Object</h3>
            <p>Every window contains a document</p>
            <p>document.write() puts some text on the page, replacing the whole document if there is stuff there</p>
            <p>You can use document.write() in a script tag to inject a string into markup</p>

            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <p>small files saved locally on a user's computer</p>
            <p>Used to remember things about previous visits to a page</p>
            <p>cookies are often replaced by localstorage</p>
            <p>Still used to pass info between client and server on every https request</p>
            <p>Cookie example: "name=Superman; hero=true; city=Metropolis"</p>
            <p>In EU you must ask permission before setting cookies</p>

            <h4>Creating Cookies</h4>
            <p>put the cookie in the cookie jar.</p>


            <h4>Cookie expiry dates</h4>
            <p>cookies are session cookies by default.</p>
            <p>But you can add an expiration date to make them last longer</p>

            <h4>The path and domain of cookies</h4>
            <p>By default, cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain as the file was set.
                But you can change the path so that any page in the root directory can read the cookie.</p>

            <h4>Secure cookies</h4>
            <p>Add 'secure to the end of a cookie to make sure it's only transmitted over https</p>

            <h4>Deleting Cookies</h4>
            <p>You must set it to expire in the past to remove a cookie.</p>

            <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
            <p>setTimeout takes callback as first parm, num of milliseconds as second parm</p>
            <p>setInterval repeatedly calls the callback every given number of milliseconds</p>
            <p>Careful about using 'this' in timing methods. Binding is to the window, not the method's object</p>

            <h4>Animation</h4>
            <p>You can use the timing function to animate elements on page</p>
            <div id="square"></div>
            <button onclick="animateItBetter()">Make the square rotate</button>

            <h4>requestAnimationFrame</h4>
            <p>Much smoother animation performance than using timeout for animation</p>

            <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>

            <h3>The data Attribute</h3>
            <p>Used for embedding data using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser</p>
            <div data-powers='flight superSpeed' data-rating='5' data-user='DAZ'>They are used by javascript, not the
                browser</div>
            <p>Each element has a dataset property that can be used to acces data attributes</p>
            <div id='hero' data-powers='flight superSpeed'>
                Superman
            </div>

            <h3>HTML5 api's</h3>
            <p>Use feature detection before using api's</p>

            <h4>Web storages</h4>
            <p>different from cookies because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>information is not shared with the server on every request</li>
                <li>Information is available on multiple windows of the browser for the same domain</li>
                <li>Storage capacity limit is larger than cookies</li>
                <li>Data does not automatically expire.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Local storage and session storage</p>
            <p>Setting something to local storage fires an event.</p>


            <h4>Geolocation</h4>
            <p>Obtain geographic position of device</p>
            <p>Use to link to nearby places or measure the speed they are moving</p>
            <p>navigator object has a method called getCurrentPosition() that returns position object to a callback
                function</p>

            <h4>Web Workers</h4>
            <p>allows processes to be run in the background</p>
            <p>don't let long scripts make your page unresponsive</p>

            <button id='rainbow'>Change Color</button>
            <form>
                <label for='number'>Enter a Number to Factorize:</label>
                <input id='number' type='number' name='number' min=1 value='20'>
                <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
            </form>
            <div id='output'></div>

            <h4>Websockets</h4>
            <p>Allows two way server communication: push messaging</p>
            <p>When websocket successfully connects to a url, it fires an event called 'open'</p>
            <form>
                <label for='message'>Enter a Message:</label>
                <input type='text' name='message'>
                <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
            </form>
            <div id="newOutput"></div>

            <h4>Notifications</h4>
            <p>You need permission to use notifications.</p>
            <p>notifications have events to react to, like click, and close.</p>
            <p>You can open a new window when they click on it.</p>

            <h4>Multimedia</h4>
            <p>audio and video html tags</p>
            <p>Methods that go with them to set controls, etc.</p>

            <h4>Other api's.</h4>
            <p>There are so many more useful things out there.</p>

            <h3>Shims and Polyfills</h3>
            <p>shims and polyfills fill in the code for you when it's not working natively on the browser.</p>
